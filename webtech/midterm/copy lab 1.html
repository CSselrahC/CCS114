		<p style="font-family: Calibri; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
			Ikigai is a Japanese concept that roughly translates to "a reason for being" or "a reason to wake up in the morning." <br>
			It encompasses finding joy, purpose, and fulfillment in life. The concept suggests that by identifying and nurturing <br>
			the intersection of four elements, individuals can lead a fulfilling and meaningful life. These elements are:
		</p>
		
		<ol style = "font-family: Calibri">
			<li> What you love (your passion) </li>
			<ul>
				<li> This refers to activities, hobbies, or pursuits that bring you joy and fulfillment. </li>
				<li> It could be anything from painting to gardening to playing music. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li> What you are good at (your vocation) </li>
			<ul>
				<li> This involves recognizing your strengths, skills, and talents. </li>
				<li> It's about understanding what you excel at and what comes naturally to you. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li> What the world needs (your mission) </li>
			<ul>
				<li> This aspect emphasizes contributing to the greater good, making a positive impact, or serving others in some capacity. </li>
				<li> It involves identifying needs or problems in the world that resonate with you and finding ways to address them. </li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<li> What you can be paid for (your profession) </li>
			<ul>
				<li> This relates to finding a career or vocation that allows you to learn a living while also aligning with your passions, strengths, and values. </li>
			</ul>
		</ol>

		The idea behind ikigai is that true fulfillment and happiness <br>
		come from finding balance and harmony among these four <br>
		elements. It's about finding a purpose-driven life that <br>
		integrates personal fulfillment with societal contribution and <br>
		financial stability. By living in alignment with their ikigai, <br>
		individuals can experience a sense of meaning, satisfaction, <br>
		and longevity.
